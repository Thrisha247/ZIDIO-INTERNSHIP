Stock Price Forecasting Project

This project was completed as part of my Data Analytics Internship at Zidio. It focuses on forecasting stock market trends using historical data and predictive modeling techniques.

Project Goals:

- Collect and clean stock data using Python and yfinance
- Visualize stock trends over time
- Build forecasting models including ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM
- Evaluate model performance and plot forecast results

Tools and Technologies Used:

- Python
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- scikit-learn
- statsmodels
- Prophet (fbprophet)
- TensorFlow 

Project Deliverables:

- Cleaned dataset (CSV format)
- Notebook files with code for each model
- Forecast graphs showing actual vs predicted values
- Summary report of findings and insights

Instructions needed to Run:

1. Install all required libraries using pip
2. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter
3. Execute the cells in order for each model
4. Review the outputs and compare forecasting performance
